# Neural Networks

This right above you is what is called a neural network. That's right ...thrown you right into the deep end🤭🤭🤭. Lots of lines and circles and even more lines and circles and they just keep coming at you. Now, for a moment if you could pretend in your mind's eye that's a black box, almost like a circuit board with input pins and output pins, I may be able to explain to you how great an innovation this is and also the intuition and reasonings about why we care(and we care a lot about this guy in machine learning) about something so complicated-looking anyway. Having established let's see if I could get you excited enough to even try hard coding this ;-). It's really just a bunch of simple things. Hold tight!!!!

## So why did someone want to build such a thing?

That was 1947 when Alan Turing said this. So, for years after that scientists kept on thinking...
                                                            
*" but machines are idiots..if they could learn from experience....hmmm...what learns from experience...oh us!!!! Let's just try and replicate our brains then!!!!"*

And that was that!!. These neural networks are just very very simplified representations of what goes on in our brains and how we learn from experiences stored in our brain. A meticulous connection of millions of neurons(just like those circles) and millions of pathways (just like those lines), which fire and interact amongst themselves. It's fascinating(isn't it?) to see where the inspiration comes from and how it strikes them. We have come a long way since the 1950's with better algorithms but even with the best hardware available on earth, we are nowhere near to reproduce what you have in your 5 * 5 * 5 cc skull. There is a world of history and biology that I would have shared with you and probably I will write about them soon but I do encourage you to explore it on your own. You wouldn't be disppointed, I promise you.

## Let's get back to the big black box, shall we and see what goes inside it!!!

How do you describe something to a baby? Suppose you want him to remember what an elephant looks like. You say its got big ears, a trunk, a set of tusks and 4 feet. You could also describe it as something grey in colour, very tall and one with great strength. That too describes the elephant. At the same time suppose you say that the one yellow in colour, has whiskers and has 4 feet while you are describing a cat. The X_input are the descriptors or the features and so the next time the baby encounters them if it says its an elephant, that's great. But suppose the poor child paid more attention to the number of feet the animal had. So his predictions will have some error as he will just probably make a random guess as to what is a cat and what is an elephant...

Similarly, for a neural network you pass into the the features as X_input and what it predicts is the X_output.
